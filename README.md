# ArchAgent

Modern codebases evolve fast, often faster than anyone can document them. Whether you're a new contributor trying to get your bearings, or the original author revisiting a system thatâ€™s grown far beyond your memory, understanding how everything fits together is hard.

ArchAgent solves this by mapping the structure of a codebase into clear, layered architecture diagrams. It helps you see the system, its containers, components, and even code-level details, so you can focus less on spelunking and more on building.
